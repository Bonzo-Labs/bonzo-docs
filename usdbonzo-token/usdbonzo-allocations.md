# 🥧 $BONZO Allocations

The $BONZO token will have a fixed maximum supply of **400,000,000** **tokens**. The token generation event (TGE) will take place following the mainnet launch of Bonzo Finance (est. August 2024).

Once all 400,000,000 $BONZO tokens have entered circulation, the token allocation will be as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th width="190">Category</th><th width="199">Total Amount</th><th>% of Max Supply</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Community</strong></td><td>108,000,000</td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Investor</strong></td><td>44,000,000</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Core Development</strong></td><td>100,000,000</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DAO Treasury</strong></td><td>100,000,000</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ecosystem Development</strong></td><td>52,000,000</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Safety Module</strong></td><td>40,000,000</td><td>5%</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Token Genesis Allocation

Shortly after mainnet launch of the Bonzo Finance protocol, 8% of the max supply (32,013,792 $BONZO) will enter circulation and be distributed as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th width="190">Category</th><th width="199">Total Amount</th><th>% of Max Supply</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Community</strong></td><td>5,791,570</td><td>1.45%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Investor</strong></td><td>1,555,556</td><td>0.39%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ecosystem Development</strong></td><td>4,666,667</td><td>1.17%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Safety Module</strong></td><td>40,000,000</td><td>5%</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Community**

* 1.38% of the max supply (5,500,000 $BONZO) will be distributed to community members who participate in the Bonzo Finance NFT sale.
* 0.0031% of the max supply (12,601 $BONZO) is allocated to the Safety Module incentive program\*, to be distributed throughout month 1 post-TGE, incentivizing $BONZO holders to participate in this activity.
* 0.07% of the max supply (278,969 $BONZO) will be unlocked for community marketing campaigns to incentivize awareness, growth, and adoption.

### **Investor**

* 0.39% of the max token supply (1,555,556 $BONZO) will be unlocked and distributed to investors who have participated in the Bonzo Finance pre-sale. These tokens are unlocked and distributed to investors over the period of 18 months post-TGE.

### **Ecosystem Development**

* 1.17% of the max token supply ($4,666,667 $BONZO) will be unlocked for ecosystem development activities. This includes liquidity provisioning for centralized & decentralized exchanges, as well as ecosystem integration fees.

### **Safety Module**

* 5% of the max token supply (20,000,000 $BONZO) will be unlocked and allocated to the Safety Module, acting as a buffer that can be used to cover creditors in the case of unexpected shortfall events. Although these tokens will be “unlocked” and counted towards the circulating supply figure, they are only accessible in the case of a shortfall event.

## **Safety Module Incentive Program Calculations**

Users who participate in staking (locking up) tokens for a limited amount of time in the Safety Module reserve are rewarded. A portion of the “Community” token unlock schedule for $BONZO includes rewards. The APY reward for locking up $BONZO tokens is based on the following formula:

```java
0.007 * (.15 * Circulating Supply [Pre-Safety Module] Per Month)
```

This formula ensures that a minimum of 8.40% APY is rewarded for $BONZO token holders who stake to the safety module, based on 15% of the circulating supply, calculated on a monthly basis. If more (or less) than 15% of the circulating supply is staked to the safety module, the APY will be lower or higher, respectively.

As the Bonzo Finance protocol achieves economic sustainability, rather than relying on token unlocks allocated to the “community” category for reward, as it exists today, a portion of protocol fees generated will be used to reward users who continue participating in this activity. The Bonzo Finance DAO (est. launch in early 2025) will regularly reassess and vote on the reward allocation based on various economic factors.

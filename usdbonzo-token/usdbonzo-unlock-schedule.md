# ðŸ“Š $BONZO Unlock Schedule

A set of contracts that lock the $BONZO asset will be deployed upon TGE. Over a span of 5 years, starting from token genesis, these tokens will undergo a linear vesting process. These tokens will be used to support a variety of initiatives, such as community rewards, liquidity provisioning, safety module protection, and core development of the Bonzo Finance protocol.

This token unlock schedule emphasizes the teamâ€™s commitment to building a long-term, economically sustainable lending & borrowing protocol for the Hedera DeFi ecosystem, while supporting an overall increase in Hedera TVL, volume, daily active accounts, and token-based dapp utilization.

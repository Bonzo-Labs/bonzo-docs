# üéüÔ∏è Bonzo Points

Points incentive programs for protocols and networks are ubiquitous across web3 ‚Äî from LayerZero, to WalletConnect (ReOwn), and Kamino on Solana, points programs have been employed across the industry to incentivize protocol growth, liquidity, and adoption, rewarding users for these activities.

The Bonzo Points program rewards active community members who supply liquidity to and borrow liquidity from the Bonzo Finance protocol. Point earnings are based on the dollar value of supported HTS assets supplied and borrowed, and distributed on a 24 hour basis. Point earnings are used to inform claimable $BONZO at the end of every points season, each lasting 3-4 months.

Earn 2 points per $1 USD in value supplied & 8 points per $1 USD in value borrowed every 24 hours. Bonzo Points earned per account are used to inform claimable $BONZO at the end of each season; **there is no conversion rate between points to $BONZO tokens** and token distribution amounts are determined at the end of each season.\
\
The start and end date(s) for each season are found in the table below:

<table><thead><tr><th width="138">Season</th><th width="226">Start</th><th>End</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Oct 28 2024</td><td>February 28 2025</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>March 1 2025</td><td>June 2 2025</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>June 3 2025</td><td>September 3 2025</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>September 4 2025</td><td>December 8 2025</td></tr></tbody></table>

In addition to the regular seasons of points, Bonzo Finance hosted a [token weighted pre-season airdrop of points](pre-season-points-airdrop.md) for holders of HTS assets supported by Bonzo Finance. The pre-season has concluded.

### The HCS-20 Points Standard

The Bonzo Points program utilizes the Hedera Consensus Service HCS-20 standard ‚Äî this offers the unique ability for points to be tied directly to Hedera accounts on-chain ‚Äî it also allows for airdropping of points to users without them even having to connect their wallets to the protocol. Additionally, because all points are on-chain, they are verifiable and auditable.

# Pre-Season Points Airdrop

The [token-weighted airdrop of points](https://app.bonzo.finance/points) in the pre-season kicked off on **Friday, September 13th, 2024, at 4:00 PM ET**, starting with a snapshot of holders and amounts of assets in the program. The first distribution of Bonzo Points was made on **Monday, September 16th, 2024,** for the $HBARX asset and continued every other business day with a new points airdrop for every HTS asset supported by the program.

### **Bonzo NFT Points Multipliers**

Every Bonzo NFT came with a multiplier that automatically multiplies the points you earn during pre-season airdrops, giving holders an extra edge in the race to the top of the leaderboard. The multiplier applied to point earnings was based on the single highest tier NFT held in the same account that received points.

* üèúÔ∏è **Desert Bonzo**: 1.1x multiplier
* üåä **Ocean Bonzo**: 1.2x multiplier
* üöÄ **Space Bonzo**: 1.3x multiplier
* üåå **Singularity Bonzo**: 1.5x multiplier

NFTs needed to be held during snapshot periods to lock in these rewards and accelerate the path to more points and $BONZO earnings.

### **What are Flash Loans on Bonzo Finance?**

Flash Loans are a powerful tool designed for developers who want to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities, leverage trading strategies, or perform other complex financial operations. With Flash Loans, you can borrow a large amount of assets from the Bonzo Finance protocol without providing any collateral upfront. The key requirement is that the borrowed liquidity must be returned to the protocol within a single block transaction, along with the interest and fees.

To execute a Flash Loan on Bonzo Finance, developers need to create a smart contract that requests the loan, performs the desired actions, and ensures that the loan is paid back in full within the same transaction. If the loan is not repaid as expected, the entire transaction is reversed, and no changes are made to the protocol or the borrower's position.

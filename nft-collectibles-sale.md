# üñºÔ∏è NFT Collectibles Sale

The Bonzo NFT Collectibles sale is designed to foster user adoption, promote community engagement, and raise funds for business operations and continued protocol development. The sale will showcase a unique collection of NFTs, each offering a range of benefits and utilities within the Bonzo Finance ecosystem.

The Bonzo Finance website will feature these collectibles, and they will be available for purchase on the SentX marketplace. The allowlist sale is scheduled for **Monday, June 10th @ 12:00pm ET** and will last for approximately 2 hours. Following the allowlist sale, the public sale will commence, offering the remaining NFTs to the wider community.

### **Allowlist NFT Collectibles Sale**&#x20;

Leading up to the sale, select community members will be granted a spot on the "allowlist." The allowlist slots are not capped and are currently being utilized for marketing incentive campaigns, driving both user engagement with the testnet instance of the protocol and promotion of the protocol through sharing screenshots of their usage on various social channels, such as ùïè.

This allowlist enables each approved account to purchase up to 6, 4, and 1 of each NFT tier. The allowlist ensures a fair and evenly distributed allocation of Bonzo NFT Collectibles to users, contributing to broader community adoption, utilization, and decentralization of the $BONZO token airdrop.

### **Public NFT Collectibles Sale**&#x20;

After the allowlist sale concludes, any remaining NFTs will be made available to the public, allowing anyone to participate in the sale.

### **Bonzo NFT Collectables**

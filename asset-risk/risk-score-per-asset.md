## Risk Analysis per Asset <a href="#risk-analysis-per-asset" id="risk-analysis-per-asset"></a>

### Stablecoins <a href="#stablecoins" id="stablecoins"></a>

#### $USDC

USDC is primarily promoted by Coinbase and supported by the CENTRE consortium. Together with DAI, it has been the most used stablecoin in the DeFi ecosystem following a strong push from Coinbase who provides liquidity to projects.

[**HTS Token Risk**](https://hashscan.io/mainnet/token/0.0.456858)**: xxx**

Active since April 2022 with 2M+ transactions on the Hedera network.

**Counterparty Risk: xxx**

As it’s backed by real US dollars as well as other high quality reserve assets. USDC is centralized and the technology to mint new USDC, backed by USD value, is based on stringent regulatory, financial, and technological frameworks. It is currently maintained by the CENTRE consortium — a trusted entity in the ecosystem and audited monthly by Grant Thornton. USDC is one of the first regulated cryptocurrencies, bringing legitimacy to the space.

### Majors  <a href="#stablecoins" id="stablecoins"></a>

#### $HBAR

HBAR is the native cryptocurrency of the Hedera network, a public distributed ledger technology. It's used for network fees and native stkaing.

**HTS Token Risk: \[GRADE]**

HBAR is the native token of the Hedera network, operational since 2018 with billions of transactions processed.

**Counterparty Risk: \[GRADE]**

While Hedera is a decentralized network, it's governed by the Hedera Governing Council, composed of large corporations and institutions. This provides stability but also introduces some centralization. The codebase is open-source, allowing for public scrutiny. The accounts and $HBAR asset on Hedera cannot be frozen.&#x20;

**Market Risk: \[GRADE]**

HBAR has significant trading volume across multiple exchanges, with a substantial market capitalization. However, as a utility token for a specific network, it is more volatile than major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

#### $HBARX

HBARX is a liquid staking token representing staked HBAR, issued by the liquid staking provider Stader Labs on the Hedera network.

**HTS Token Risk: \[GRADE]**

As an HTS token representing staked HBAR, it inherits some of HBAR's security but adds a layer of smart contract risk.

**Counterparty Risk: \[GRADE]**

This risk depends on the key configuration of HBARX, which is an Admin Key (Threshold 3/5). Users must trust the provider to manage staked assets properly and honor redemptions.

**Market Risk: \[GRADE]**

While HBARX is pegged to HBAR, it may have lower liquidity and fewer trading pairs compared to HBAR itself. Its value could be affected by both HBAR price movements and staking-related factors.

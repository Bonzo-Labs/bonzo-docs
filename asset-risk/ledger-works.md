# Ledger Works

The composability of DeFi enables Bonzo Finance to interoperate with the entire Hedera ecosystem. However, it also exposes the protocol to potential financial contagion. Assets supported by the protocol affect the platform at its core — particularly assets that can be supplied as collateral — which safeguard the protocol's solvency.&#x20;

To ensure that an asset holds a reasonable amount of risk, Bonzo Finance has contracted [Ledger Works](https://www.lworks.io/) for real-time risk assessment and monitoring, using machine learning / AI and actuarial models.

Ledger Works modeling takes into account data from SaucerSwap liquidity pools, Bonzo Finance utilization, counter parties (Supra oracles), and macro-economic forces, to derive appropriate risk parameter configurations for assets supported by Bonzo Finance.

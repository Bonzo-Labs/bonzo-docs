# 🏠 Overview & Resources

The [Bonzo Finance](https://www.bonzo.finance/) protocol is an open source, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol built on the Hedera network. It is designed to facilitate the lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies, with a focus on HBAR, Hedera Token Service (HTS) tokens, and wrapped major assets. Bonzo prioritizes censorship resistance, security, and self-custody, enabling users to transact without reliance on trusted intermediaries.

> _Suppliers provide liquidity to Bonzo Finance asset markets to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (a single “atomic” flash loan) fashion._

Bonzo Finance is based on [Aave v2](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0) — the most utilized lending & borrowing protocol on Ethereum — and adapted to the Hedera EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and native Hedera Token Service (HTS).

The Bonzo Finance protocol inherits the Hedera network's high throughput, fast transaction finality, and a low, fixed, U.S. dollar-denominated fee structure. Additionally, Hedera's architecture ensures fair transaction ordering, [mitigating the risk of MEV attacks](https://hedera.com/blog/does-maximal-extractable-value-mev-exist-on-hedera) commonly seen on alternative EVM-based DeFi protocols.

# ðŸ¤  Overview

Welcome to the official documentation for Bonzo Finance â€” the premier lending and borrowing protocol of the Hedera network. The organizational structure of Bonzo is comprised of these four components:

* **Bonzo Labs:** A corporation in Dubai which has developed the Bonzo Finance protocol, along with the user interface.
* **The Bonzo Finance Protocol:** A liquidity pool-based decentralized lending protocol built on Hedera. Bonzo is powered by open source smart contracts from Aave v2 that have been adapted to Hedera's native smart contract and token services. Bonzo utilizes over-collateralized loans, flash loans, and dynamic interest rate models to facilitate permissionless lending and borrowing of crypto assets.
* **The Bonzo Interface:** An easy-to-use, web-hosted user interface that allows user interaction with the Bonzo protocol. The interface is one of many ways to interact with Bonzo.
* **The Bonzo DAO (Coming Soon):** A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that guides protocol development and governance through collective decision-making by its community members, enabled by the $BONZO token.

## Bonzo Protocol

The [Bonzo Finance](https://www.bonzo.finance) protocol is a decentralized protocol designed to facilitate the lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies, with a focus on HBAR, wrapped major assets, and Hedera Token Service (HTS) tokens. Bonzo prioritizes censorship resistance, security, and self-custody, enabling users to transact without reliance on trusted intermediaries that may selectively restrict access.

Bonzo Finance integrates with the Hedera Token Service (HTS) by adapting the Aave v2 lending protocol to interact with the Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS) through EVM precompiles. This integration allows for high throughput, fast transaction times, and a low-cost, U.S. dollar-denominated fee structure. Additionally, Hedera's architecture ensures fair transaction ordering on Bonzo Finance, mitigating the risk of MEV attacks commonly seen on alternative EVM-based protocols.

Bonzo Finance utilizes Supra and Pyth oracles to provide accurate and reliable price feeds for the lending and borrowing of assets, ensuring transparent and efficient operations within the protocol.

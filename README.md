# Introduction to Bonzo

### What is Bonzo Finance?&#x20;

[Bonzo Finance](https://www.bonzo.finance) is a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol built on the Hedera network. Users can participate as lenders, supplying liquidity to the market to earn passive income, or as borrowers, obtaining loans in an overcollateralized manner.

Please join the Bonzo Finance community on [Discord](https://www.bonzo.finance/discord) and [ùïè](https://www.x.com/bonzo\_finance); the Bonzo Finance team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use the protocol.

### Why Bonzo Finance?

Bonzo Finance protocol will been audited prior to its mainnet deployment. The protocol is completely open source, allowing anyone to interact with the user interface, API, or directly with the smart contracts on the Hedera network. Being open source means that you can build third-party services or applications to interact with the protocol and enrich your product.

### How do I interact with Bonzo Finance protocol?&#x20;

To interact with Bonzo Finance protocol, simply supply your preferred supported asset and amount. After supplying, you will earn passive income based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, supplying assets allows you to borrow by using your supplied assets as collateral. Any interest you earn by supplying funds helps offset the interest rate you accumulate by borrowing.

### What is the cost of interacting with Bonzo Finance protocol?&#x20;

Interacting with the protocol requires transactions and, therefore, transaction fees for Hedera network usage. These fees depend on the network status and transaction complexity.

### Where are my supplied funds stored?&#x20;

Your funds are allocated in a smart contract. The code of the smart contract is public, open source, and will be formally verified and audited by third-party auditors. You can withdraw your funds from the pool on demand or export a tokenized version (bTokens) of your lender position. bTokens can be moved and traded like any other cryptographic asset on Hedera.

### Is there any risk?&#x20;

No platform can be considered entirely risk-free. The risks related to the Bonzo Finance protocol include smart contract risk (risk of a bug within the protocol code) and liquidation risk (risk on the collateral liquidation process). Every possible step has been taken to minimize risk as much as possible ‚Äî the protocol code is public and open source, and it will be audited prior to its mainnet deployment.

You can find additional risk and security-related information in the risk framework and security and audits sections.

### Bonzo Token&#x20;

Once Bonzo tokens becomes available, they will used for Bonzo Finance protocol governance. Bonzo tokens are used to vote and decide on the outcome of Bonzo Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Apart from this, Bonzo tokens can be staked within the protocol's Safety Module to provide security/insurance to the protocol/lenders. Stakers earn staking rewards and fees from the protocol.

Documentation on tokenomics and governance will be made available in the whitepaper and with further detail in the [full documentation](https://docs.bonzo.finance).

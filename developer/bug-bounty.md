# Bug Bounty

Protocol security is a top priority for Bonzo Finance Labs. To encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities, a Bug Bounty Program exists with financial rewards based on the severity of the identified issues.

### Within Scope <a href="#scope" id="scope"></a>

* Bonzo Lend [testnet & mainnet contracts](bonzo-lend/lend-contracts.md) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bonzo-Labs/bonzo-finance-contracts)
* Bonzo Lend [testnet & mainnet interface](https://testnet.bonzo.finance)
* Bonzo Vaults [mainnet contracts](bonzo-vaults-beta/vaults-contracts.md) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bonzo-Labs/beefy-hedera-contracts)
* Single-Sided Staking contracts and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bonzo-Labs/bonzo-staking-module)

### Out of Scope <a href="#scope" id="scope"></a>

* Third-party contracts not directly associated with Bonzo Finance
* Known issues from audits, bug bounty reports, or in-development fixes
* Third-party applications which utilize Bonzo Finance contracts
* Any findings that rely on Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

### Rewards <a href="#scope" id="scope"></a>

**The Bug Bountry program includes the following four-level severity scale, based on the OWASP risk rating methodology:**

**⚠️ Critical:** Issues that could impact numerous users and have serious reputational, legal, or financial implications. An example would be being able to lock contracts permanently or take funds from all users.

**🟥 High:** Issues that impact individual users where exploitation would pose reputational, legal, or moderate financial risk to the user.

**🟨 Medium:** The risk is relatively small and does not pose a threat to user funds.

**🟩 Informational:** The issue does not pose an immediate risk but is relevant to security best practices.

**Bonzo Finance Labs will determine rewards based on the bug's severity and its potential for exploitation. Rewards may be disbursed in USDC, various cryptocurrency assets, or a mix of both. Receipt of reaward requires idenenty**&#x20;

### Disclosure

Please report vulnerabilities to [contact@bonzo.finance](mailto:contact@bonzo.finance). An acknowledgment will be sent within two to three business days if the issue identified qualifies. **Do not disclose the bug publicly** until it has been resolved and official notice has been provided by Bonzo Finance Labs, acting as an independent protocol development and operations steward for the Bonzo Finance Foundation.

A detailed report of a vulnerability increases the likelihood of a reward — it also may increase the reward amount. Please provide as much information about the discovered vulnerability as possible, including:

* A detailed description of the conditions required for reproducing the bug
* Step-by-step guide or proof of concept for reproduction
* Detailed explanation / reasoning of the potential consequences if exploited
* Suggestions on how best to remediate the vulnerability (optional)

Anyone who reports a unique, previously-unreported bug or vulnerability — which results in a change to the codebase or configuration — AND who keeps such discovery confidential until it has been resolved will be financially rewarded.

### Eligibility

**To be eligible for a reward under this program, you must meet the following conditions:**

1. **Uniqueness:** Discover a previously unreported, non-public vulnerability that is not already known to the Bonzo Finance Labs or Bonzo Finance Foundation team(s) and is within the scope of the program.
2. **First Disclosure:** `Be  first` to disclose the unique vulnerability to [contact@bonzo.finance](mailto:contact@bonzo.finance) and adhere to the program's disclosure requirements.
3. **Detailed Reporting:** `Provide` comprehensive information that enables core engineers to reproduce and remedy the vulnerability.
4. **Non-Exploitation:** `Do not` exploit the vulnerability in any form, including publicizing it or seeking other forms of profit, except under this program.
5. **Non-Publication:** `Do not` disclose the vulnerability to the public or any third party without our explicit approval.
6. **Ethical Conduct:** `Provide` best faith efforts to prevent privacy violations, data destruction, service interruption, and any degradation of in-scope assets.
7. **Lawful Behavior:** `Do not` engage in any unlawful conduct during the disclosure process, such as making threats, demands, or extortion of any kind.
8. **Age Requirement:** `Must be` at least 18 years of age; if younger, you may participate with the consent of a parent or guardian.
9. **Legal Compliance:** `Cannot be` subject to U.S. sanctions or reside in a U.S.-embargoed or sanctioned country.

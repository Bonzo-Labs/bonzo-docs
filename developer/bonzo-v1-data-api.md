* **Account Insights**: Retrieve detailed account information, including balances and solvency computations.
* **Public Endpoints**: Open API for developers to build custom solutions and integrations.
* **Swagger Interface**: User-friendly interface for exploring and testing API endpoints.
* **OpenAPI Specification**: Comprehensive API definitions for easy integration.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:

```
https://data.bonzo.finance/
```

## Common Response Structure

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

* 200: Success
* 404: Resource not found
* 503: Service unavailable (upstream mirror node error)

Error responses include a text explanation of the issue.

## Rate Limiting

* Current rate limits: None
* Please implement reasonable request throttling in your applications

## Best Practices

1. Cache responses when appropriate to minimize API calls
2. Use the dashboard endpoint instead of market when you have an account ID
3. Implement exponential backoff for retries
4. Monitor the health factor of positions if building liquidation bots

## Example Implementation

Here's a simple JavaScript example to fetch market data:

```javascript
async function getBonzoMarketData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://bonzo-data-api-eceac9d8a2aa.herokuapp.com/market');
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    
    // Process reserves data
    data.reserves.forEach(reserve => {
      console.log(`${reserve.symbol}: ${reserve.utilization_rate}% utilization`);
      console.log(`Supply APY: ${reserve.supply_apy}%`);
      console.log(`Borrow APY: ${reserve.variable_borrow_apy}%`);
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching market data:', error);
  }
}
```

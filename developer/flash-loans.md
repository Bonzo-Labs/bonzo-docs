# âš¡ Flash Loans

Flash Loans are a type of uncollateralized loan that allows developers to borrow substantial amounts of assets for a brief period, execute a defined set of strategies, and repay the loan, all within a single "atomic" transaction. This functionality opens up a world of possibilities for DeFi users, enabling them to take advantage of arbitrage and liquidation bot opportunities, optimize their positions, and access liquidity in ways not previously possible.

Once borrowing becomes available on Bonzo Finance, developers will be able to build smart contracts that enable flash loan functionality. Tutorials and code examples for flash loans are coming soon.

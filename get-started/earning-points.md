# üéüÔ∏è Earning Points

Bonzo Finance is introducing a unique points reward system built on the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS-20) standard. This innovative feature is designed to incentivize and reward our users for their active participation and contribution to the growth of the Bonzo Finance ecosystem.

By leveraging the power of HCS-20, Bonzo Finance offers a secure, transparent, and efficient system for tracking and distributing points to users. These points will be awarded based on various activities, such as supplying and borrowing assets, participating in governance decisions, and engaging with the Bonzo Finance community.

Defining the specific mechanisms and criteria for earning and redeeming points within the Bonzo Finance ecosystem is still being determined. Careful consideration for the best ways to align the points reward system with the protocol's overall mission and vision are being made, ensuring that it offers meaningful incentives and benefits for the ecosystem.

Stay tuned for more information on how to earn and utilize points within the Bonzo Finance ecosystem, as well as the launch timeline for this exciting new feature. Your patience and support as we work towards bringing this innovative rewards system to life is appreciated.

# Withdraw Assets

Bonzo Finance offers users the flexibility to withdraw supplied assets at any time, provided those assets are not currently serving as collateral for outstanding loans. This feature ensures that users maintain control over their liquidity.

Only assets not actively securing a loan can be withdrawn freely â€” if a user has borrowed against their supplied assets, they may need to repay their loan or adjust your position before initiating a withdrawal.\

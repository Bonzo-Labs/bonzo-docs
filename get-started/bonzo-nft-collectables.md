# üñºÔ∏è Bonzo NFT Collectables

Bonzo Collectables are currently in a planning stage for the upcoming Initial NFT Offering (INO), which will introduce Bonzo Collectibles to the Hedera ecosystem. These unique NFTs will not only serve as a way for our community to showcase their support for the project but also offer a range of utilities and benefits within the Bonzo Finance protocol.

Captivating illustrations and designs for the Bonzo Collectibles are being created, ensuring that every NFT is visually appealing and reflects the spirit of our community. Additionally, utility aspects of these NFTs are being considered, aiming to provide holders with exclusive access to features, rewards, and governance within the Bonzo Finance protocol.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as details of the Bonzo Collectibles are still being finalized. Regular updates on the progress of the INO, including the final illustrations, utility, and launch date will be provided soon. Delivering a high-quality and rewarding experience for the Bonzo community through the Bonzo Collectibles is a top priority. Stay tuned for more information in the coming weeks and months.

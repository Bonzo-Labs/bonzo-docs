### The HCS-20 Points Standard

The Bonzo Points program utilizes the Hedera Consensus Service HCS-20 standard ‚Äî this offers the unique ability for points to be tied directly to Hedera accounts on-chain ‚Äî it also allows for airdropping of points to users without them even having to connect their wallets to the protocol. Additionally, because all points are on-chain, they are verifiable and auditable.

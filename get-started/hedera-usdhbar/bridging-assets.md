# Bridging Assets

{% hint style="warning" %}
Bonzo Finance will initally support $HBAR, $HBARX, $USDC, $SAUCE, $XSAUCE, and $KARATE â€” as the project evolves, the Bonzo Finance Labs team anticipates supporting wrapped major assets on Hedera via supported bridges.
{% endhint %}

[Hashport](https://www.hashport.network/) is a trusted bridging solution that enables users to seamlessly transfer digital assets between Hedera and alternative EVM networks. With support for popular blockchains such as Ethereum, Optimism, Cronos, BNB, Polygon, Fantom, Moonbeam, Base, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Aurora, Hashport offers a wide range of options for users looking to bring their assets to the Bonzo Finance platform.

When these tokens are bridged to Hedera using Hashport, they are denoted with an **\[hts]** subscript to differentiate them from their native Hedera counterparts. For instance, **USDC\[hts]** represents **USDC** tokens that have been bridged from Ethereum, while **USDC** refers to the native Hedera version of the token.\
\
Once your assets have been successfully bridged to Hedera, you can then use them on the Bonzo Finance platform to lend, borrow, or stake, depending on the available options for the specific token. If you have any questions about the bridging process or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Bonzo Finance support team for assistance.

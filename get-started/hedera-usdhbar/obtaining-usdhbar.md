# Obtaining $HBAR

To interact with the Bonzo Finance protocol and perform transactions, you will need HBAR, the native token of the Hedera network. HBAR is used to pay transaction fees on Hedera network, similar to how ETH is used on the Ethereum network. Here are a few ways you can obtain HBAR:

### Centralized Exchanges

Many popular cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, BitStamp and MEXC, support HBAR trading. You can find a comprehensive list of exchanges that offer HBAR on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hedera/). \
\
Simply create an account on one of these exchanges, complete the necessary verification steps, and purchase HBAR using your preferred payment method.

### FIAT On-Ramps & Gateways

If you prefer to buy HBAR directly using your local currency, you can use FIAT on-ramp gateways like [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/buy/hbar) and [Banxa](https://banxa.com/). These services allow you to purchase HBAR using a credit or debit card, bank transfers, Apple Pay, or Google Pay. You can access these gateways either through their websites or directly within the [HashPack](https://www.hashpack.app) wallet, a popular Hedera-compatible wallet.

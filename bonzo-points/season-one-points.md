# Season One Points

After the [pre-season](https://docs.bonzo.finance/hub/get-started/bonzo-points/pre-season-points) has concluded and the Bonzo Finance protocol launches on mainnet, season one of Bonzo Points will start. Point earnings convert to claimable $BONZO at the end of a every points season, each lasting 6 months, with three seasons in total.

Points earnings are based on the dollar value of assets supplied to and borrowed from the protocol, distributed on a 24 hour basis — supported assets of the protocol can be found on the [Bonzo Finance homepage](https://bonzo.finance/).

Details of points earning calculations for season one are found in the table below:

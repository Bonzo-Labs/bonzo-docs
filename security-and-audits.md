# ðŸ”’ Security & Audits

As the testnet phase concludes, Bonzo Finance will initiate a code freeze to ensure the stability and security of the protocol. During this period, the team will engage a reputable auditing firm â€” either Halborn, Certik, or Hacken â€” to conduct a comprehensive and formal security audit of the protocol's smart contracts and infrastructure.

After the formal audit is completed, the official audit report will be made available within the projectâ€™s open source GitHub repository.

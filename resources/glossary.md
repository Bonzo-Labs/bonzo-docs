<table><thead><tr><th width="174">Term</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Annual Percentage Yield (APY)</td><td>APY represents the estimated annual return on your investment, taking into account the effect of compound interest. It differs from Annual Percentage Rate (APR), which does not consider compounding.</td></tr><tr><td>aTokens</td><td>Tokens that represent a user's share of the supplied assets in a lending pool. They are minted when a user supplies an asset and burned when the user withdraws their funds. bTokens accrue interest over time based on the lending pool's performance.</td></tr><tr><td>Bonzo Token (BONZO)</td><td>The native governance token of the Bonzo Finance protocol. BONZO token holders can participate in the decision-making process by voting on protocol upgrades and parameter changes.</td></tr><tr><td>Borrow APY</td><td>The real-time interest APY for borrowing. This rate is variable and determined by the ratio of total supplied and borrowed by all users.</td></tr><tr><td>Borrow Cap</td><td>The maximum total amount of an asset that can be borrowed from the Bonzo Finance protocol across all users. Borrow caps help protect the protocol by preventing excessive borrowing of any single asset and maintaining healthy liquidity levels.</td></tr><tr><td>Collateral</td><td>An asset that a borrower pledges as security for a loan. In Bonzo Finance, users can supply various cryptocurrencies as collateral to borrow other assets.</td></tr><tr><td>Collateralization Ratio</td><td>The ratio between the value of the collateral and the value of the borrowed asset. It determines the maximum amount a user can borrow based on their collateral.</td></tr><tr><td>Flash Loan</td><td>Uncollateralized loans that allow users to borrow funds without providing upfront collateral, as long as the borrowed amount plus fees are returned within the same transaction. Flash loans enable various use cases such as arbitrage, collateral swapping, and debt refinancing.</td></tr><tr><td>Health Factor</td><td>A metric that represents the safety of a borrower's position. It is calculated by dividing the total value of the collateral (multiplied by the liquidation threshold) by the total borrowed amount. A health factor below 1 indicates that the position is undercollateralized and subject to liquidation.</td></tr><tr><td>Interest Rate Model</td><td>The algorithm that determines the interest rates for borrowing and lending based on the supply and demand dynamics of each asset. Bonzo Finance employs a variable interest rate model that adjusts rates in real-time to maintain a balanced market.</td></tr><tr><td>Liquidation</td><td>The process of selling a borrower's collateral to repay their outstanding debt when their position becomes undercollateralized (i.e., when the health factor drops below 1).</td></tr><tr><td>Liquidation Bonus</td><td>An incentive given to liquidators in the form of a bonus on top of the liquidated collateral. It encourages liquidators to participate in the liquidation process and maintain the stability of the protocol.</td></tr><tr><td>Liquidation Threshold</td><td>The percentage of the collateral's value at which a borrower's position becomes eligible for liquidation. It is specified for each collateral type and helps maintain a safe cushion for the protocol.</td></tr><tr><td>Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio</td><td>The maximum percentage of an asset's value that a user can borrow. It is determined by the asset's risk profile and helps maintain a healthy level of collateralization.</td></tr><tr><td>Reserve Factor</td><td>A percentage of interest payments (protocol fees) that is set aside as protocol reserves, which are used to sustain DAO operations and protocol development. The Reserve Factor also acts as an additional layer of security for the protocol, being employed in cases of shortfall events.</td></tr><tr><td>Reserves</td><td>The smart contracts that hold the supplied assets and manage the lending and borrowing activities within the Bonzo Finance protocol. Each supported asset has its own reserve.</td></tr><tr><td>Slope 1</td><td>The gradual interest rate increase applied when utilization of an asset pool is below the "optimal utilization" point. Slope 1 determines the borrow APY and Supply APY for an asset pool.</td></tr><tr><td>Slope 2</td><td>The steep interest rate increase applied when utilization of an asset exceeds the "optimal utilization" point. Slope 2 is designed to discourage 100% utilization of an asset pool and determines the borrow APY and Supply APY for an asset pool.</td></tr><tr><td>Supply APY</td><td>The real-time earnings APY for supplying. This rate is variable and determined by the ratio of total supplied and borrowed by all users.</td></tr><tr><td>Supply Cap</td><td>The maximum total amount of an asset that can be supplied to the Bonzo Finance protocol across all users. Supply caps help manage risk by limiting the protocol's exposure to any single asset.</td></tr></tbody></table>

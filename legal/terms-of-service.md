# 📃 Terms of Service

⏰ **Last Updated: November 1, 2025**\
\
These Terms of Service (this “**Agreement**”) explain the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Services provided by **Bonzo Finance Foundation** (the “**Foundation**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”). The **Services** include, but are not limited to: (a) the website at **bonzo.finance**, including its front-end graphical user interface (the “**Interface**”), and (b) any other websites, applications, or domains that link to this Agreement. This Agreement **incorporates by reference** our Privacy Policy (available at **bonzo.finance/privacy-policy**). By accessing or using any of the Services, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement **in its entirety**. **If you do not agree to any part of this Agreement, you are not authorized to access or use the Services.**

You represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g. 18 years old in the U.S.) and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any organization you represent. You further represent that you are **not** (a) subject to any economic or trade sanctions or on any list of prohibited parties (e.g. as designated by U.S. OFAC), nor (b) a citizen or resident of any country or region that is subject to comprehensive sanctions by the United States. You also represent that your use of our Services will comply with **all applicable laws and regulations**, and that you will not use the Services to conduct or facilitate any illegal activity.

Upon request, you agree to provide certain personal information for identity verification and anti-financial-crime purposes, and you permit us to keep a record of such information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to modify or revoke your access to the Services based on our ongoing compliance obligations. **The Services are offered at the Foundation’s sole discretion** – we may choose not to offer the Services, or may suspend or terminate your access to the Services, at any time and for any reason, without prior notice.

> **NOTICE:** This Agreement contains important provisions, including a binding **arbitration clause** and a **class action waiver**, which affect your rights on how disputes are resolved. The Services are available to you **only if** you agree to these terms in full.

**Clarification of Parties.** The Services are provided solely by **Bonzo Finance Foundation** (the “**Foundation**”) as the legal counterparty to this Agreement. **Bonzo Finance Labs FZCO (“Bonzo Labs”)** is an independent open-source contributor to the Bonzo Finance protocol, is **not** a party to this Agreement, and assumes **no** contractual liability to you under these Terms.

**Covered Parties (for §§ 4.7, 5, 6, 7, and 8).** “**Covered Parties**” means **(i)** the Foundation and each of its current and former officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, service providers, successors, and assigns; and **(ii)** only those persons or entities **engaged by the Foundation under a written agreement** to perform services **for the Services** — expressly including **Bonzo Finance Labs FZCO** **when** acting as a Service Provider. Inclusion of Bonzo Labs as a Covered Party does **not** make Bonzo Labs a party to this Agreement, an affiliate of the Foundation, or create any partnership, joint venture, or agency; it also does not grant third-party-beneficiary rights except as expressly stated in § 8.

**Exclusions.** Covered Parties do not include independent DAO participants, governance delegates, tokenholders, forum authors, or risk stewards/proposers; nor third-party strategy / vault operators, validators / node operators, oracle or bridge providers, wallet providers, or exchanges.

### 1. Our Services

**1.1 The Interface and Protocol.** The Interface provides a web-based means of access to a **decentralized lending and borrowing protocol** built on the Hedera network, which allows users to lend, borrow, and earn yield on crypto assets via the Bonzo Finance protocol (the “**Protocol**” or “**Bonzo Finance**”). You understand and acknowledge that **the Protocol itself is not our Service** – it consists of autonomous smart contracts governed as described in the protocol documentation. The Foundation **does not control or operate** any version of the Protocol on any blockchain network. By using the Interface, you understand that you are **not lending or borrowing assets from us**, and we do not operate any lending pools or control the execution of transactions on the Protocol.

To access the Protocol, you must use a **non-custodial wallet** (of your choice) that allows interaction with public blockchains. Your relationship with your wallet provider is governed solely by that third party’s terms. We **do not have possession or control** of the contents of your wallet and cannot retrieve or transfer your assets for you. By connecting your wallet to the Interface, you agree to this Agreement and all terms incorporated by reference.

**1.2 Other Services.** From time to time, we may offer additional products or features. Any such product, if offered by us and linked to these Terms, will be deemed part of the “Services” and will be subject to this Agreement unless stated otherwise.

**1.3 Third-Party Services and Content.** When you use our Services, you may encounter or use content, services, or features provided by third parties (for example, third-party wallet software or external links). Your use of any third-party products, services, or content is subject to those third parties’ terms, policies, or fees, not this Agreement. We do not control, endorse, or assume any responsibility for any third-party resources or promotions. **Your access of any third-party service is at your own risk**, and you expressly release us from any liability arising from your use of or interactions with such third parties.

**1.4 Developers & Integrators.** These Terms apply to any access to the Protocol, whether through the Interface, direct smart-contract calls, SDKs, or APIs. You must not circumvent access controls or geographic/sanctions screens, and you may not use the Services to provide regulated financial services without all required authorizations. Use of our trademarks and brand assets is prohibited without written permission.

### 2. Modification

**2.1 Modifications of this Agreement.** We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or update this Agreement at any time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date above and publish the revised Agreement. **All modifications are effective when posted.** By continuing to access or use the Services after an update, you confirm your acceptance of the  Agreement. If you do not agree with a modification, you must immediately stop using all Services.

**2.2 Modifications of our Services.** We reserve the right (but not the obligation) to at any time: (a) modify, substitute, eliminate, or add to any of the Services; and (b) review, edit, disable, or remove any content or information on the Services. We may do so with or without notice to you. You acknowledge that content available through the Services may be removed or altered by us without prior notice.

### 3. Intellectual Property Rights

**3.1 Generally.** We (and our licensors, where applicable) own all intellectual property and other proprietary rights in and to the Services and their contents, including but not limited to the software, text, images, trademarks, service marks, logos, patents, designs, and the “look and feel” of the Services. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services **for their intended purposes**, in accordance with this Agreement. **No rights or licenses** are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any IP rights owned or controlled by us or our licensors, except for the limited license above. You agree not to copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Services except as expressly permitted by us in writing or by applicable law.

The Services may allow you to create, post, store, or share content (including messages, files, documents, graphics, software, videos, audio, comments, feedback, or other materials – collectively, “**Posts**”). We **do not claim ownership** over your Posts, and nothing in this Agreement restricts your rights to your own content. However, by using the Services and posting or transmitting any content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use, copy, modify, display, perform, and distribute that content (including any intellectual property in it) for our current and future business purposes, including operating, promoting, and improving the Services. This includes any content linked to or associated with any NFTs that are displayed via our Services. You also grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) under any of your intellectual property or proprietary rights to use any **feedback, suggestions, or ideas** you submit regarding the Services, for any purpose.

You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights, licenses, consents, and authority to post the content you submit and to grant the licenses above. You further represent that your content **does not violate any law or infringe any rights** of any third party (such as intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights). We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any user content. We have no obligation to monitor or remove Posts, but we reserve the right to remove or disable access to any Post at any time, **without notice**, at our discretion (for example, if we determine a Post is unlawful, offensive, or violates this Agreement).

**3.2 Third-Party Resources and Promotions.** Our Services may include references or links to third-party information, resources, or services that we do not control or operate, and third parties may offer promotions related to your use of the Services. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party resources or promotions. If you access third-party resources or participate in third-party promotions, you do so at your own risk. **This Agreement does not govern your relationship with those third parties**, and you release us from any liability arising from your use of or participation in them.

**3.3 Additional Rights.** We reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement, regulatory authorities, or court orders requesting or directing us to disclose information (including content) that you provide, as permitted by applicable law.

### 4. Your Responsibilities

**4.1 Prohibited Activity.** You agree **not** to engage in, or attempt to engage in, any of the following categories of prohibited activities in relation to your access or use of the Services:

* **Intellectual Property Infringement:** Using the Services to transmit or store content that infringes anyone’s copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, right of publicity/privacy, or other proprietary rights.
* **Cyberattacks:** Any activity that seeks to interfere with or compromise the integrity, security, or proper functioning of any computer system, network, service, or website – including by introducing viruses, malware, or launching denial-of-service attacks.
* **Fraud and Misrepresentation:** Conducting fraudulent activities or impersonating others, including providing false, misleading, or deceptive information to us or any user in order to unlawfully obtain property or funds.
* **Market Manipulation:** Any activity that violates applicable laws or regulations concerning market integrity for lending, borrowing, or crypto asset markets (for example, wash trading, pump-and-dump schemes, or other deceptive trading practices).
* **Securities/Derivatives Violations:** Using the Services in any manner that violates securities or commodities laws – for example, unregistered offering of securities, or offering illegal leveraged or margined commodity transactions to retail customers.
* **Dealing in Illegal or Stolen Property:** Using the Services to buy, sell, or transfer stolen assets, fraudulently obtained assets, or any other illicit goods.
* **Objectionable Content:** Using the Services to transmit any content that is unlawful, harmful, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise objectionable (including content that targets or exploits anyone under 18, or that promotes hate or discrimination).
* **Unlawful Behavior:** Engaging in any other activity that violates any applicable law or regulation, or that could subject the Foundation or the Protocol to liability (including, without limitation, violating U.S. or other anti-money laundering, countering terrorist financing, or economic sanctions laws).

**4.2 Lending & Borrowing.** You acknowledge and agree that: (a) any lending or borrowing transaction you submit through the Services (i.e. via the Interface) is initiated solely by you, on an unsolicited basis; (b) you have not received any investment, financial, or legal advice from us in connection with any transaction; (c) we do not conduct any subjective suitability or credit review of your transactions or decisions; and (d) if a transaction occurs using your authenticated credentials or wallet, we will deem that transaction authorized by you. You are fully responsible for the transactions associated with your address.

**4.3 Non-Custodial Services; No Fiduciary Duties.** All Services provided are **non-custodial**. This means we **never custody or control your digital assets** at any time; any assets you use in connection with the Protocol remain under your control through your own wallets. _You alone_ are responsible for securing and maintaining control of the private keys to your wallets. **Never share** your wallet credentials or seed phrases with anyone. We are not responsible for any loss or theft of assets resulting from you losing control of your wallet. We make **no representations or warranties** about the functionality or security of any wallet you choose to use with our Services, and we shall not be liable for any acts or omissions by you (or any third party) in connection with your wallet.

Nothing in this Agreement creates any fiduciary or advisory relationship between you and us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree that the Foundation owes **no fiduciary duties** or analogous responsibilities to you. This Agreement creates only an ordinary commercial relationship, and the **only** duties and obligations we owe you are those expressly set forth in this Agreement.

**4.4 Compliance and Tax Obligations.** The Services (or certain features) may not be available or appropriate in all jurisdictions. You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with **all laws and regulations** that may apply to you as a result of your use of the Services. This includes, without limitation, any tax obligations. **Your use of the Services or the Protocol may have tax implications** (for example, income, capital gains, sales, or value-added taxes). It is **your responsibility** to determine what taxes, if any, apply to the transactions you conduct, and to collect, report, and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authorities. We are **not responsible** for determining whether taxes apply to your activities or for collecting or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction.

**4.5 Network Fees (“Gas”).** Any blockchain transaction you submit through the Services will require payment of applicable network fees (commonly called “gas” or transaction fees) to the relevant blockchain network (e.g., Hedera). **You are solely responsible** for paying any such gas fees for each transaction you initiate. We do not receive these fees and have no control over their pricing, which can be volatile.

**4.6 Protocol Fees.** The Bonzo Finance Protocol may charge certain protocol-level fees associated with lending and borrowing. By using the Protocol via our Services, you agree to pay any applicable protocol fees, which may include, for example:

* **Reserve Factor Fees:** A portion of the interest paid by borrowers that is diverted to the Protocol’s reserves as a safety buffer.
* **Liquidation Fees:** A fee taken from collateral when a position is liquidated (due to falling below required collateral levels), paid to liquidators as an incentive for maintaining platform health.
* **Flash Loan Fees:** A fee charged on uncollateralized “flash loans” (loans that are borrowed and repaid within one transaction), typically a percentage of the amount borrowed.

By using the Protocol, you acknowledge that these fees will apply as determined by the Protocol’s governance process. Fee rates and structures are subject to change through community governance. It is your responsibility to stay informed about the current fee rates and to factor these costs into your decision-making when using the platform.

**4.7 Release of Claims.** You assume all risks associated with your use of the Services and the Protocol. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you **release and forever discharge Covered Parties (including Bonzo Labs)** from any and all claims, causes of action, demands, or liabilities arising from or related to your use of, or inability to use, the Services or the Protocol.

_If you are a California resident:_ You waive the protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which states: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, and that if known by him or her would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

### 5. DISCLAIMERS

**5.1 ASSUMPTION OF RISK.** By accessing or using the Services or the Protocol, you represent that you are **financially and technically sophisticated** enough to understand the inherent risks involved in using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems. You should have a working knowledge of digital assets (including Hedera’s native token HBAR, stablecoins, and other tokens following the Hedera Token Service and EVM standards). You acknowledge that **digital asset markets are nascent and highly volatile**, and you should be prepared for significant volatility in token values due to factors like adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You understand that **anyone can create a token**, including fake versions of existing tokens or tokens that misleadingly claim to represent projects. You accept the risk that you may accidentally interact with such tokens. You also recognize that stablecoins may not be as stable as advertised (they may not be fully collateralized or could de-peg) and could be subject to rapid loss of value.

You further understand that **smart contract transactions automatically execute** and settle on the blockchain, and **completed transactions are generally irreversible**. The cost and speed of transacting on blockchain networks (like Hedera) are variable and can increase at times due to network congestion or other factors. If you supply assets to the Protocol (for example, by providing liquidity), those assets may gain or lose significant value based on market fluctuations of the assets in the lending pools. **You acknowledge that we do not own or control any “cross-chain bridges”** (tools that transfer assets between blockchains), and we make no warranties about the safety or functionality of any third-party bridge you might use.

In summary, **you understand and agree that you assume all risks** associated with accessing and using the Services and the Protocol. The Foundation **does not own or control the Protocol** (which consists of autonomous smart contracts), and **we cannot be held liable** for any outcomes (including losses) that you experience. You **accept full responsibility** for all consequences of interacting with the Protocol through our Interface.

**5.2 NO WARRANTIES.** **The Services are provided to you strictly on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis.** To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, we **disclaim all warranties and representations**, whether express, implied, or statutory, including (but not limited to) any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and any warranties arising from course of dealing or usage of trade. **Your use of the Services is at your own risk.** We do not guarantee that access will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or secure; we do not guarantee that the information provided through the Services is accurate, reliable, complete, or current; and we do not guarantee that the Services are free of errors, viruses, or other harmful components. No advice, information, or statement that any **Covered Parties** makes should be treated as creating any warranty not expressly stated in this Agreement.

**Covered Parties** **do not endorse or assume the responsibility of** any third-party content, information, or advertisements that may be presented via the Services. You understand and acknowledge that the data shown through the Interface (for example, token prices, NFT metadata, or other blockchain data) **may contain errors or bugs**. It is your responsibility to cross-check important information (for example, by consulting the relevant blockchain or official Protocol sources) before taking action. We do not routinely monitor the accuracy of on-chain data displayed through the Interface.

Likewise, the **Protocol** itself is provided “AS IS” and without any warranty of any kind. Although Bonzo Labs and other contributors have developed and audited the Protocol’s initial code, the Protocol now operates **in a decentralized manner** via smart contracts on public networks. **No developer or entity involved in creating, deploying, or maintaining the Protocol (including the Foundation and Bonzo Labs) is liable for any claims or damages whatsoever** that may arise from your use, inability to use, or interactions with the Protocol. This disclaimer includes any and all types of damages or liability, whether direct or indirect, incidental, special, punitive, consequential, or otherwise (including loss of profits, assets, or value). We again do not endorse or assume responsibility for statements or promises made by third parties about the Services or the Protocol.

**Any financial transactions that you engage in via the Protocol are executed by smart contracts** over which we have no control once you initiate them. We **cannot reverse or undo** any on-chain transaction that has been confirmed.

**5.3 NO INVESTMENT ADVICE.** All information and content provided through the Services is for **general informational purposes only** and should **not** be construed as investment, financial, or legal advice. The Foundation is **not advising you** with respect to any digital asset or investment strategy. Nothing in the Services constitutes a recommendation that any token or investment is suitable for you. You alone are responsible for evaluating the merits and risks of any transaction you choose to undertake. You should consider your own financial situation, objectives, and risk tolerance, and consult with professional advisors as needed. **You should not take (or refrain from taking) any action** in reliance on any information presented via the Services. By providing information about tokens or markets, we are not recommending or endorsing any particular token, protocol, or opportunity.

### 6. Indemnification

You agree to **indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Covered Parties (including Bonzo Labs)** from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use or misuse of the Services or the Protocol; (b) your violation of this Agreement or any law; (c) any content you submit or any activity under your wallet; or (d) any dispute between you and a third party. We may assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of such matter. You shall not settle any claim without our prior written consent.

### 7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances shall **any Covered Party (including Bonzo Labs)** be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or relating to your use of (or inability to use) the Services or the Protocol, even if **Covered Parties** or their representatives have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability includes, without limitation, any loss of profits, loss of data, loss of goodwill, business interruption, or other intangible losses; any damage resulting from hacking, tampering, or unauthorized access to or use of the Services or the Protocol or the information contained therein; and any damage resulting from your interactions with the Protocol or other users.

**Covered Parties** assume **no liability or responsibility** for any of the following: (A) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies in content; (B) personal injury or property damage of any nature whatsoever resulting from your access to or use of the Services or the Protocol; (C) unauthorized access to or use of any secure server or database in our control, or any information stored therein; (D) interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Services or the Protocol; (E) bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or other harmful code that may be transmitted to or through the Services or the Protocol by any third party; or (F) any errors or omissions in any content or data, or any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content or data posted, emailed, or otherwise made available through the Services or the Protocol; and (G) the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.

**Covered Parties** have **no liability** for any transactions, payments, or smart contract operations that you engage in via the Services or Protocol. You are solely responsible for your on-chain transactions (and any gas fees paid). Except as may be expressly set forth by us, **Covered Parties do not provide refunds** for any transactions.

**Covered Parties** make no warranties or representations about any **third-party services** (including third-party wallets, websites, or content that you access through our Services). Any links to third-party sites or information are provided for convenience, and you assume all risk if you access them. **Covered Parties** shall **not be liable** for any damages arising from your use of any third-party product or service accessed via our Services.

**Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties or liabilities (for example, the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages),** so some of the above limitations may not apply to you. **To the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that certain limitations of liability are not enforceable, Covered Parties liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, the **total aggregate liability of all Covered Parties** for all claims arising out of or related to the Services or this Agreement shall not exceed **USD $100** (or the equivalent in local currency), regardless of the theory of liability.

The foregoing disclaimers and limitations of liability shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and **will survive** any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

### 8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

**8.1 Governing Law.** This Agreement (and any dispute (“**Dispute**”) between you and us arising out of or related to this Agreement or your use of the Services) is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **Cayman Islands**, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The Services shall be deemed to be based solely in the Cayman Islands, and the availability of the Services in other jurisdictions shall not be interpreted as a voluntary submission to the personal jurisdiction of courts in any other forum.

**8.2 Informal Resolution.** Before initiating formal proceedings, you agree to email **legal@bonzo.finance** with a written notice describing the Dispute and your contact information (a “**Dispute Notice**”). We will work with you in good faith to resolve the Dispute for **60 days** after receipt of your Dispute Notice. If the Dispute is not resolved within that time, either party may proceed to arbitration under Section 8.3. The parties may, by mutual agreement, attempt **non-binding mediation** before or during arbitration.

**8.3 Arbitration (LCIA).** **Any Dispute between you and any Covered Party** arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Services, or the Protocol **shall be finally resolved** by binding arbitration administered by the LCIA under the **LCIA Rules** then in effect, as modified by this Section 8. The **seat (legal place) of arbitration** shall be the **Cayman Islands**. The tribunal shall consist of **one arbitrator**. The **language** of the arbitration shall be **English**. Hearings may be conducted by video conference unless the tribunal directs otherwise. The tribunal may award any relief available at law or in equity. The **tribunal may apportion arbitration costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees** between the parties as it deems appropriate. The award shall be **final and binding**, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. **Either party may seek interim or conservatory measures** from the courts of the Cayman Islands or any other court of competent jurisdiction, without waiving arbitration. **Each Covered Party (including Bonzo Labs)** is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Section **8** (and Sections **4.7, 5, 6, and 7**) and may enforce them to the same extent as if it were the Foundation.

**8.4 Waiver of Class Actions and Jury Trial.** You must bring any Dispute against any **Covered Party** **only in your individual capacity**, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any class, collective, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation of proceedings are **not permitted**. To the extent any Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, **each party waives any right to a jury trial** and agrees that such proceedings shall be brought **exclusively in the courts of the Cayman Islands** (subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements), and each party submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

### 9. Miscellaneous

**9.1 Entire Agreement.** This Agreement (including incorporated references like the Privacy Policy) constitutes the **entire agreement** between you and the Foundation regarding the Services. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Services. **No oral or written information or advice given by us or our representatives** shall create any additional warranties or obligations beyond those expressly stated herein.

**9.2 Assignment.** You may **not assign or transfer** any rights or obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment by you in violation of this section is null and void. We may freely **assign or transfer** this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any party at our sole discretion, including to any affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

**9.3 Not Registered with SEC or Other Agencies.** The Foundation (and the Services) is **not registered** with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any other securities or financial regulatory authority. You understand and acknowledge that we do not broker deals or solicit orders on your behalf, and we do not facilitate the execution or settlement of your transactions on the Protocol — those occur **entirely on public, distributed blockchains** (like Hedera). We **do not** and **cannot** guarantee that using our Services will yield you the best available market rates or terms for any transaction. Any reference on our Interface to a “best rate” or similar is for informational purposes and does not guarantee you will receive a better price than elsewhere.

**9.4 Relationship of the Parties.** Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create any joint venture, partnership, agency, or employment relationship between you and the Foundation. You and we are independent parties. You have no authority to act on behalf of the Foundation, and we have no authority to bind or commit you in any manner. **Nothing in this Agreement creates any partnership, joint venture, or agency between the Foundation and Bonzo Labs.**

**9.5 Notices and Communications.** You agree that we may provide you with any notices or communications electronically: for example, via email (to any email address you provide) or through the Services (such as an in-app notification). You are responsible for keeping your contact information current and accurate. If we send you an electronic communication but you do not receive it because your information on file is incorrect or out-of-date (or due to spam filters, etc.), it will still be deemed that **we provided notice**.

If you need to contact us or give formal notice of any matter: you must **email us at** **legal@bonzo.finance**. Your notice will be effective when we confirm receipt in writing. In your email notice, please include your contact information and a clear description of your request or concern. This email method shall serve as the agreed means of providing notice to the Foundation for all purposes of this Agreement.

**9.6 Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect. However, **if Section 8.4 (Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver)** is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of Section 8 (Governing Law and Dispute Resolution) shall be deemed void. In such case, the parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Cayman Islands for resolution of any disputes, and you waive any objection based on inconvenient forum or lack of personal jurisdiction. The purpose of this Agreement is to be enforced to its fullest extent, and its fundamental provisions (such as risk allocations and dispute resolution) are essential to the parties’ bargain.

**9.7 No Waiver.** Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of that right or any other provision. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by us to be effective. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law or equity.

**9.8 Regional Consumer Law.** Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or restrict any rights you may have under **mandatory consumer-protection laws** that apply to you (e.g., in the EEA or UK). To the extent of any **non-waivable conflict** with such mandatory laws, those laws will control for affected users in those jurisdictions.

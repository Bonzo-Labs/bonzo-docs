# 📄 Bonzo Points Terms & Conditions

**⏰ Last Updated:** **November 17, 2025**

### 1. Acceptance; Relationship to Main Terms

**1.1 Contracting Party.** The Bonzo Points Program (the “Program”) is offered by Bonzo Finance Foundation (the “Foundation”). By participating, you agree to these Program Terms (the “Points Terms”) and the Foundation’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Main Terms”). Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings in the Main Terms.

1.2 **Clarification of Parties.** The Services and this Program are provided solely by the **Foundation**. **Bonzo Finance Labs FZCO (“Bonzo Labs”)** is an independent open-source contributor, is **not** a party to these Points Terms, and **assumes no contractual liability** to you.

1.3 **Covered Parties (for §§ 8–10).** “**Covered Parties**” means (i) the Foundation and each of its current and former officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, service providers, successors, and assigns; and (ii) only those persons or entities **engaged by the Foundation under a written agreement** to perform services **for the Services or the Program** or **at the Foundation’s written direction** (each, a “**Service Provider**”), **but solely while acting within the scope of that engagement**—expressly including **Bonzo Labs** **when** acting as a Service Provider. Covered Parties **do not include** independent DAO participants, governance delegates, tokenholders, forum authors, or risk stewards (acting in that capacity)/proposers, nor third-party vault operators, validators/node operators, oracle/bridge providers, wallet providers, or exchanges.

**1.4 No Monetary Value.** Bonzo Points (“Points”) have no monetary value, are non-transferable, and are not property. Points are promotional, revocable units used to measure Program participation. They do not entitle you to any payment, redemption, equity, or revenue share.

**1.5 Void Where Prohibited.** The Program is void where prohibited by law. Participation is your responsibility and at your own risk.

### 2. Program Overview; Seasons; Eligible Activity

**2.1 Program Structure.** The Program awards Points for Eligible Activity related to the Bonzo Finance ecosystem. The Foundation may modify mechanics, rates, lists of eligible assets, networks, or activities at any time.

**2.2 Seasons.** The Program may operate in time-boxed “Seasons” (e.g., Pre-Season; Season One; Season Two; etc.). Start/end dates and any Season-specific rules (rates, caps, eligible assets/vaults) will be published in a Season Schedule (e.g., [https://docs.bonzo.finance/hub/staking-nfts-and-points/bonzo-points](https://docs.bonzo.finance/hub/staking-nfts-and-points/bonzo-points)) and may be updated from time to time.

**2.3 Eligible Activity.** Unless the Season Schedule states otherwise, Eligible Activity may include:

* **Lend Supply:** Supplying supported assets to the Protocol.
* **Borrow:** Borrowing supported assets from the Protocol.
* **Vault Deposits:** Holding balances in Eligible Bonzo Vaults disclosed in the Season Schedule (including third-party-operated vaults surfaced in the Interface; such operators are not Covered Parties).
* **Other Activities:** As published for a given Season (e.g., governance participation captured by on-chain proofs, bridging via designated routes, or ecosystem campaigns).

**2.4 Rates & Weighting.** Each Season’s **Rate** will specify baseline earning rates (e.g., points per USD), any activity weighting, per-asset or per-vault multipliers, and any **caps** (per wallet, per asset, or global).

**2.5 NFT Multipliers.** Season-specific NFT multiplier rules (including stacking and caps) will be set in the Season Schedule. Example (illustrative only; subject to the Season Schedule):

* Base Multipliers: Desert 1.1x; Ocean 1.2x; Space 1.3x; Singularity 1.5x.
* Cybernetic: +0.05x each; may stack with one Base or Cybernetic; overall cap 2.0x.

2.6 Vault Eligibility. Eligible Vaults and any per-vault multipliers are listed in the Season Schedule. Vault eligibility may differ by strategy, or risk criteria, and may change at any time.

***

### 3. Measurement; Oracles; Rounding; Adjustments

**3.1 USD Valuation.** Unless stated otherwise, balances and flows are valued in USD using the Foundation-designated price sources (e.g., Chainlink/Supra or internal aggregates) at times and intervals specified for the Season (e.g., 24-hour snapshots).

**3.2 Snapshots & Windows.** Earning is computed over the Measurement Window for the Season (e.g., daily at 00:00 UTC). Deposits/withdrawals between snapshots may earn pro-rata only if/when specified.

**3.3 Rounding.** Point calculations may include rounding (e.g., to whole points). Minor calculation differences due to rounding, indexing latencies, reorgs, or oracle deviations are expected and accepted.

**3.4 Adjustments.** The Foundation may recalculate, adjust, or revoke Points to correct for errors, exploits, oracle failures, chain reorgs, vault incidents, or abuse. The Foundation’s determination is final.

***

### 4. Distribution; No Entitlement

**4.1 Reference Only.** Points are a reference metric the Foundation may use to guide community allocations of $BONZO governance tokens or other rewards. Any distribution is at the Foundation’s sole discretion.

**4.2 Season-by-Season.** Conversion mechanics (if any), vesting/lock-ups, eligibility checks (e.g., KYC/sanctions), and allocation methodologies may vary by Season and will be published when applicable. No specific conversion rate or allocation is promised.

4.3 **Expiration; Reset.** Unless stated otherwise in the Season Schedule, Season Points do not carry over and expire at Season end.

4.4 **Tax.** Distributions (if any) may be taxable. You are solely responsible for tax reporting and payment.

### 10. Disclaimers; Liability; Indemnity

10.1 **Assumption of Risk.** Crypto activities involve substantial risks (volatility, smart-contract failure, oracle failures, third-party protocols, network outages). You participate at your own risk.

10.2 **No Warranties.** The Program is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” To the maximum extent permitted by law, Covered Parties disclaim all warranties (merchantability, fitness, non-infringement, accuracy, availability).

10.3 **Limitation of Liability.** Under no circumstances shall any Covered Party be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, or for lost profits, data, goodwill, or opportunity. Aggregate Cap: To the maximum extent permitted by law, the total aggregate liability of all Covered Parties for all claims arising out of or related to the Program, the Services, the Protocol, or these Points Terms shall not exceed USD $100 (or local-currency equivalent), regardless of theory (contract, tort—including negligence—strict liability, statute, or otherwise), even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose. Multiple claims do not enlarge this cap. Non-Excludable Liability: Nothing herein excludes or limits liability that cannot lawfully be excluded or limited (e.g., fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation).

10.4 **Indemnification.** You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Covered Parties from and against any claims, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your Program participation, your violation of these Points Terms or law, or your fraud, negligence, or willful misconduct.

### 11. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution (LCIA)

11.1 **Governing Law.** These Points Terms are governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles.

11.2 **Informal Resolution.** Before formal proceedings, email legal@bonzo.finance with a description of the dispute. We will work in good faith to resolve it within 60 days.

11.3 **Arbitration (LCIA).** Any dispute between you and any Covered Party arising out of or related to the Program, these Points Terms, the Services, or the Protocol shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the LCIA under the LCIA Rules then in effect. Seat: Cayman Islands. Tribunal: one arbitrator. Language: English. Hearings may be by video conference. The tribunal may award any relief available at law or in equity and may apportion costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. Confidentiality: The existence of the arbitration, submissions, and any award are confidential, except as required for enforcement/by law or to professional advisers bound by confidentiality. Non-Party / Smart-Contract Orders: The tribunal shall not issue orders purporting to bind non-parties (e.g., validators/node operators or decentralized governance participants) or requiring modification, shutdown, or deployment of autonomous smart contracts. Either party may seek interim measures from Cayman courts or another court of competent jurisdiction without waiving arbitration. Third-Party Beneficiary: Each Covered Party (including Bonzo Labs) is an intended third-party beneficiary of this §11 (and §§10.3–10.4) and may enforce them.

11.4 **Class Action/Jury Waiver.** You must bring any dispute only in your individual capacity; class, collective, representative, or private-attorney-general proceedings are not permitted. To the extent a dispute proceeds in court, each party waives any right to a jury trial and agrees to exclusive jurisdiction in the courts of the Cayman Islands (subject to jurisdictional requirements).

11.5 **Regional Consumer Law.** Nothing in these Points Terms excludes or restricts any rights you may have under mandatory consumer-protection laws that apply to you (e.g., in the EEA or UK). To the extent of any non-waivable conflict, those laws control for affected users.

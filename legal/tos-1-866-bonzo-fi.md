**How it works (voice).** If you **call**, you’ll hear a playful recording. You **may** choose to **leave a voicemail**; that’s optional.

**Opt-out & help.** You can opt out **any time** by replying **STOP** (we also honor END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, QUIT). For help, reply **HELP** or email [**contact@bonzo.finance**](mailto:contact@bonzo.finance). We honor revocation of consent by any **reasonable means**.

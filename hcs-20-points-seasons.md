# üïπÔ∏è HCS-20 Points Seasons

The introduction of [HCS-20 points](https://patches-1.gitbook.io/hcs-20-auditable-points) (auditable points standard on the Hedera network) provides an additional incentive for Bonzo Finance users to supply liquidity to and borrow liquidity rom the protocol. This reward system utilizes the native HCS-20 standard, ensuring transparency and audibility of points, increasing the adoption of the Hedera network‚Äôs native functionalities.

[Points systems are commonly employed](https://www.theblock.co/learn/274899/what-are-crypto-points) by web3 protocols found across Ethereum, Solana, and other major public blockchain networks. By offering points for various actions taken across the protocol, the project encourages users to become active participants, while avoiding the tokenomic and regulatory pitfalls associated with ‚Äúairdrop faming‚Äù. In addition, it creates a competitive and gamified environment that boost community engagement, sentiment, and adoption.

Bonzo Finance will be hosting three ‚Äúseasons‚Äù of points, with each season lasting a period of \~6 months:

|                | Season 1         | Season 2         | Season 3         |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| **Start Date** | Mainnet Launch   | February 1, 2025 | August 1, 2025   |
| **End Date**   | January 31, 2025 | July 31, 2025    | January 31, 2025 |
|                |                  |                  |                  |
